# Helios

A simple project to create a DND character builder.

Your question may be "Why build a new character builder when Aurora is available?".

Because it is unmaintained, not opensource and cross-platform.

So I want to build Helios. A sibling to Aurora.

## Building

This program is written in Java. So JDK 17+ and Maven are needed to build a package.

To compile the package with all needed dependencies.

```
mvn compile assembly:single
```
